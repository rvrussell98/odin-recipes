            <li>Season the beef on all sides with salt. Place on a rack over a sheet tray and place uncovered in the refrigerator for 12 to 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the beef from the fridge and season with pepper. Add the olive oil to a large pot over high heat until it smokes.</li>
            <li>Place in the beef, turn the heat down to medium and sear on all sides until it is completely golden brown all around.</li>
            <li>Set the beef aside on a plate and add the onions and leeks, season with salt, and sauté for 4 to 6 minutes. Then, turn the heat down to low medium and continue cooking for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant, which takes 30 to 45 seconds. Deglaze with ¼ cup of wine and cook until it’s absorbed. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the ¾ cup wine, beef stock, bay leaves, thyme, parsley, salt, and pepper and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add back in the seared beef and bring the mixture to a boil. Add on a lid, place it on a rack in the lower third of the oven, and cook at 325° for 3 ½ to 4 hours or until fork tender and has an internal temperature of 200° to 210°.</li>
            <li>With about 70 minutes left in the cooking process, add the potatoes, prepared carrots, celery, and any other vegetables to the pot along with the beef and finish cooking alongside the pot roast.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the oven and carefully set aside only the beef roast. Mix softened butter and flour to make a beurre manie.</li>
            <li>Add the beurre manie to the pot with the liquid and vegetables and cook over low to medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens like a gravy.</li>
            <li>Finish the mixture by stirring in optional vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Add the beef back to the pot and serve.</li>
