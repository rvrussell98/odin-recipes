            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow bowl, combine panko, garlic powder, and 1 cup Parmesan. Into another shallow bowl, pour flour. In a third shallow bowl, beat eggs with 1 tablespoon water.</li>
            <li>Pat chicken dry; season with salt and pepper. Dip into flour, shaking off excess, then into egg, then into panko mixture, gently pressing to adhere.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix mozzarella and remaining 1 cup Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Heat broiler. In a large, heavy pot over medium heat, heat oil until a deep-fry or instant-read thermometer registers 350°; if it smokes a bit, that’s okay. Set a wire rack in a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Working one at a time, fry chicken until one side is golden brown, about 1 minute. Flip and continue to fry until golden brown on the other side and the sound of the frying chicken gets slightly louder—this is the moisture evaporating from the chicken—about 1 minute more. Transfer to prepared rack. Repeat with remaining chicken. Spoon some marinara over chicken. Sprinkle with cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Broil, watching carefully, until cheese is melted and brown spots form, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide chicken among plates. Top with basil. Serve with remaining marinara alongside.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
