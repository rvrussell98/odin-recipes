        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by removing your Filet Mignons from the fridge about 30-60 minutes before cooking them. Just unwrap them, place them on a plate, salt/pepper them and let them sit on the counter. This is a major part in yielding tender, juicy steaks.</li>
            <li>Once ready, heat the oven to 360°F and place a cast-iron skillet over high heat on your stove.</li>
            <li>Let it heat up well, then add the oil and sear your filet steaks without moving them until a brown crust forms on the bottom and they easily release from the pan. Flip and sear/brown the other side in the same way.</li>
            <li>Immediately take the pan off the heat, then add the butter, garlic and rosemary to the pan. The butter will splatter and melt immediately. I like to baste the steaks with a few tablespoons of the butter before adding them to the oven.</li>
            <li>Place the skillet in the hot oven for 2-8 minutes, depending on how done you like your beef and the exact size of your Filet Mignons. Mine took 3 minutes to cook to medium-rare.</li>
            <li>Once done, you’ll want to remove the skillet from the oven. Remove the Filet Mignons to a plate, tent with foil and allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving with the butter and garlic from the pan.</li>

        </ol>
